Maintaining a uniform style and following conventions means that we can more easily use \"pattern-matching\" to infer what various symbols are and what invariants are true about them. Creating common, required idioms and patterns makes code much easier to understand. In some cases there might be good arguments for changing certain style rules, but we nonetheless keep things as they are in order to preserve consistency."

More complex inline functions may also be put in a <placeholder-2/> file for the convenience of the implementer and callers, though if this makes the <placeholder-3/> file too unwieldy you can instead put that code in a separate <placeholder-4/> file.

For example, if your code parses data files from foreign sources, it may be appropriate to hard-code the non-ASCII string(s) used in those data files as delimiters. More commonly, unittest code (which does not need to be localized) might contain non-ASCII strings. In such cases, you should use UTF-8, since that is an encoding understood by most tools able to handle more than just ASCII. Hex encoding is also OK, and encouraged where it enhances readability — for example, <placeholder-1/> is the Unicode zero-width no-break space character, which would be invisible if included in the source as straight UTF-8."
