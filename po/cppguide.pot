Maintaining a uniform style and following conventions means that we can more easily use \"pattern-matching\" to infer what various symbols are and what invariants are true about them.

In some cases there might be good arguments for changing certain style rules, but we nonetheless keep things as they are in order to preserve consistency."

More complex inline functions may also be put in a <placeholder-2/> file for the convenience of the implementer and callers, though if this makes the <placeholder-3/> file too unwieldy you can instead put that code in a separate <placeholder-4/> file.
